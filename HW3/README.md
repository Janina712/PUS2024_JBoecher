The employment assignment allowed us to practice conducting statistical test (z-test, chi-square test) to test the null/alternative hypotheses we learned to come up with in previous homeworks. 

The water consumption assignment was designed to have us practice conducting univariate and multivariate regression models and how to evaluate and compare different models. 

I worked on both assignments with Anmol Arora.
