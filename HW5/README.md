This assignment introduced random forest models (regression and classification). Importantly, decision trees have the ability to provide a ranking of feature importance, unlike many other ML models. In addition to learning about the random forest model, this assignment allowed us to struggle with real data (e.g., different naming conventions across datasets) and compare our findings to a publication.
