Homework 1: Philly Parks


This assignment was designed to help us become familiar with basic operations in pandas to extract descriptive statistics from a dataframe. We encountered statistical concepts discussed in class and useful functions, such as group_by(). Writing captions made us reflect on what mean vs. median tells us about the data distribution. 

I worked on this alone this time.
