This repository contains all work related to “SPPA720 Principles of Urban Data Science” - a graduate level course at the Biden School of Public Policy and Administration taught be Dr. Federica Bianco. 

I’m currently a master’s student in bioinformatics and have a background in linguistics/cognitive neuroscience. I took ML and Time Series Analysis in spring 2022 and have completed more computational and data science-oriented coursework since. I enjoy solving data science type tasks and given my background, hope to pursue a career in public health research. I’m particularly interested in understanding urban determinants of health, such as exposure to hazardous air pollutants, chronic traffic noise, access to green spaces, safe pedestrian paths, etc. to inform public policy. I hope that this course will allow me to deepen my understanding of data science methods and to develop a ‘portfolio’ of projects in urban informatics that I could reference as relevant experience when applying for jobs in this field.
